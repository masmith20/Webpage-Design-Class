	<h2>The Circular Saw</h2>
	<p><!--use nbsp to indent paragraph--> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tabitha Babbitt's hometown benefited from forestry industry, and while Babbitt weaved, 
	she would watch the men working on cutting wood, when she eventually came up with the idea for an easier way to cut wood.</p>
	
	
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The problem with the way men were cutting wood was that the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/pit-saw">Pit Saw</a> only cut when you went forward with it, 
	so the mere purpose of pulling it the other way was to get it back to its starting position. Babbitt saw this as a huge waste of energy. </p>

	</figure>
	
	<p class="next_para">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tabitha Babbitt took a circular blade and fixed it onto her spinning wheel. She controlled the movement of 
	the blade by using the pedal on the spinning wheel used to spin the the thread onto the wheel. 
	As the wheel spun and the blade chopped the wood, no extra energy was wasted. </p>
	
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After what became known as the circular saw, her most well-known invention, 
	Tabitha went on to create more inventions including the ones listed on the right. </p>

	<h2>Why Tabitha Babbitt is Overlooked in History</h2>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Tabitha broke gender norms by inventing something used in a field that is dominated by men, 
	she still is overlooked in history. Many history books do not dive into Babbitts story, and some do not even credit her with her invention, 
	as people like <a href="http://www.deckervillelibrary.com/the-first-table-saw-invented/">Samuel Miller</a> also are said to use the circular saw at their mills. However, we must continue sharing Tabitha’s story along with 
	other women like her whose great accomplishments are brushed away in history.</p>
